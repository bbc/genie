# Upgrade Notes
All breaking changes between Genie versions will be listed here

# -.-.-
* Local is now on ports `9000` for `npm run start` and `9001` for `npm run start:pack` for compatibility with Cypress tests.

# 3.9.0
* Fonts have been moved into a fonts.json file.
* theme/items is now theme/collections

# 3.8.0
* Gel layout now sets scrollFactor zero on all items so camera movement is ignored.
If creating custom items and adding them to layout `setScrollFactor(0)` should be used.

# 3.7.0
* Asset packs and screen config have been moved into a folder for each screen.
* Screen config is no longer contained within a theme and sceneKey object.
* Achievements enabled flag in game config has been removed. Disable achievements by providing no achievements.
* There is no longer a file to specify extra configs to load, add these to an asset pack instead and load through the Phaser Cache.

# 3.6.0
* Current screen config has moved from `this.context.theme` to `this.config`
* `state.js` has been renamed to `states.js` and its exported `create` method is now named `initState`

# 3.5.0
* Theme config background furniture arrays are now added via `theme.background.items`

# 3.4.3
* main.js now passes setup data through as a single object:
`startup({ screens, settings, gameOptions })`
See main.js in the Genie src folder for the format.

# 3.4.0
* Backgrounds are all now completely configured by theme.
e.g: previously the home screen would always load `home.background` and `home.title`
they are now configured using the background items system available to all screens.
