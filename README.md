# BBC Games - Genie

A modular framework to simplify the construction of children's games.

## To view:

`npm start` then navigate to the URL listed in the terminal output.

## To build:

`npm run build` runs `webpack --config build-scripts/webpack.config.js` and creates a bundle in the `output` directory.
This is the the build script that will be used by CI.

### Visualizer

`npm run build` will also generate a webpage in the output folder with a visual representation of the modules which make up the bundle. This allows us to investigate bundle size issues that may occur in the future.

## Testing builds
    `npm run start:pack` then navigate to the URL listed in the terminal output. Creates a final build then serves it locally.

To see this simply open `output/stats.html` in a browser.

Alternatively load http://localhost:8080/index.html as a file URL (requires `--allow-file-access-from-files` in Chrome.)

## To test:

`npm test` will run tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and check them with ESLint.

`npm run jest` runs the unit tests only.


## Creating a new version for release:

To automatically bump the package version and create a corresponding Github release tag, use the following command (please replace `patch` with `minor` or `major` as required):

```
npm version patch -m "Write your release notes here"
```

Then push to Github to see the new version appear.

(Please note you will need to create a branch, rather than doing this directly on master, as master is currently protected.)

## Code linting:

`npm run eslint` runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Auto documentation:

`npm run docs` generates documentation using [JSDoc](https://usejsdoc.org/) and outputs to `docs/api/index.html`.

## Debug Mode:

To access debug mode, add the `debug=true` query string to the URL: http://localhost:8080/?debug=true

This will output game loading progress and asset keylookups to the console. Pressing "q" will show the layout overlay, to show the game bounds.

## Sanity Check Mode:

"Sanity Check" mode is a series of screens that make use of Phaser features such as collisions, rotations, tweens etc. It is to ensure that these features are working as intended.

To access "Sanity Check" mode, add the `sanityCheck=true` query string to the URL: http://localhost:8080/?sanityCheck=true.

While in this mode, press `D` on your keyboard to view the Phaser Arcade Physics hitbox over each sprite.
