# BBC Games - Genie

A modular framework to simplify the construction of children's games.

## To view:

`npm run start` then navigate to the URL listed in the terminal output.

## To build:

`npm run build` runs `webpack --config build-scripts/webpack.config.js` and creates a bundle in the `output` directory.
This is the the build script that will be used by CI. It will also automatically generate theme 2.

## To automatically generate theme 2

`npm run create-theme2` will copy the `default` theme to the `theme2` folder, and make all the images greyscale so you can easily see the difference between the themes. You can then access it on http://localhost:9000/?theme=theme2

### Visualizer

`npm run build` will also generate a webpage in the output folder with a visual representation of the modules which make up the bundle. This allows us to investigate bundle size issues that may occur in the future.

## Testing builds
`npm run start:pack` then navigate to the URL listed in the terminal output. Creates a final build then serves it locally.

To see this simply open `output/stats.html` in a browser.

Alternatively load http://localhost:9000/index.html as a file URL (requires `--allow-file-access-from-files` in Chrome.)

## To test:

`npm test` will run tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and check them with ESLint.

`npm run jest` runs the unit tests only.

## To test using Cypress

`npm run start:pack` will create a locally hosted build. In a new terminal running `npm run cy:local` will run the cypress tests against the locally hosted build

`npm run cy:headless` will run the cypress tests against a deployed Test url.

`npm run cy:terminal` will launch the cypress terminal. From here you can pick which suites execute. Useful for developing cypress tests. 
`npm run cy:terminal:local` will also launch the cypress terminal, however this is reliant on `npm run start:pack` as it will connect to the local hosted URL.

## Code linting:

`npm run eslint` runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Auto documentation:

`npm run docs` generates documentation using [JSDoc](https://usejsdoc.org/) and outputs to `docs/api/index.html`.

## Debug Mode:

To access debug mode, add the `debug=true` query string to the URL: http://localhost:9000/?debug=true

This will output game loading progress and asset keylookups to the console. Pressing "q" will show the layout overlay, to show the game bounds.
